# Design Findings — sample aircraft (endurance mission)

What the optimizer has actually said about the DESIGN_SPEC.md plane so far.
All numbers from uncalibrated models (construction profile from ballparks,
propulsion from datasheets/proxy tables): **trust the rankings and the active
constraint set, not the absolute minutes** (see VALIDATION_ANCHORS.md).
Generated 2026-07-23, M3/M4 runs. Updated same day after the SM fix
(Munk fuselage term + regression derivative) and the span-cap raise to 3.0 m.

## 1. The champion (post-SM-fix, span cap 3.0 m)

**Span 2.59 m — an interior optimum, off every bound.** With load-scaled spars the
mass price of span honestly balances induced drag. Champion: span 2.59, root chord
181 mm, taper 0.73, tail arm 550 mm, tail scale 0.79, spars 14×1.1 / 12×1.4 mm,
ballast 0 g, battery full forward, cruise 10.1 m/s, AUW 1988 g, 23.4 W →
**107.5 min** (multi-start 3/3 identical; flatness peaks at ~2.6 m:
88 → 98 → 104 → 107 min over 1.75–2.5 m; spans ≥2.75 fail to converge with the
14 mm spar-OD ceiling).

### Active constraint set

| Constraint | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Static margin ≥ 8% | **active** | Tail sized by stability (scale 0.79, arm at its 550 mm floor). Now includes the Munk fuselage term. |
| Gust margin CL ≤ 0.7·CLmax | **active** | Sets cruise speed, not the wind floor. |
| Ballast ≥ 0 | **active at 0** | Battery at forward stop; the spec's 70 g nose lead is avoidable by layout. |
| Trim throw ≤ ±5.5° | **active** | The champion trims right at the ⅓-throw reserve — ruddervator authority is a real currency here. |
| Spar OD ≤ 14 mm (fit in the root section) | **active** | Optimizer wants max-diameter thin-wall; also: the spec's 10×8 center spar **fails** the 5 g / SF 2.0 root-stress check (~300 vs 200 MPa allowable). |
| Stall ≤ 8 m/s | active | The wing-area sizer (kept at 8.0 by decision, 2026-07-23). |

## 2. Airfoil study (discrete outer loop, full re-optimization per candidate)

| Airfoil | Endurance smooth (min) | Endurance tripped (min) | ΔCD tripped |
|---|---|---|---|
| **AG35** | **104.1** | **95.2** | 0.0054 |
| SD7037 (spec) | 99.4 | 89.6 | 0.0060 |
| E205 | 91.9 | 84.7 | 0.0043 |
| MH32 | 90.8 | 79.8 | 0.0060 |

**AG35 beats the spec's SD7037 by ~5% smooth and ~6% tripped, and the ranking
does not flip when laminar runs are lost** — a robust recommendation, not a
laminar-fragile one. Print-friendliness caveat: AG35 is thinner aft (~8.7% t/c,
thin TE) — check single-perimeter printability before adopting.

## 3. Endurance vs. wind-penetration Pareto (ε-constraint sweep)

| Min cruise speed | Endurance | Cruise power |
|---|---|---|
| 10 m/s | 99.4 min | 25.6 W |
| 11 m/s | 99.0 min | 25.7 W |
| 12 m/s | 84.5 min | 30.6 W |
| 13 m/s | 70.8 min | 37.1 W |
| ≥14 m/s | no converged solution (infeasible vs. non-converged not yet distinguished) |

Wind capability is free up to 11 m/s, then costs ~14 min per m/s. If the field
regularly sees >6–7 m/s wind, that's the trade to argue about.

## 4. Model-fidelity caveats attached to all of the above

- Cruise power sits at the **optimistic edge** of the real-aircraft bands
  (14 W/kg vs. measured 34 W/kg for a draggier Mini Talon; sailplane floor
  10–17 W/kg) — smooth polars, no prop-in-wake losses, vendor motor constants.
- **Static margin (fixed 2026-07-23, watch it anyway):** the model now carries a
  Munk slender-body fuselage term and estimates dCm/dCL by regression over a
  ±2° alpha window, because LiftingLine's local derivative oscillates with
  alpha (raw local slopes at the old champion: 0.12 → −0.01 → 0.06). Numeric
  cross-check at the new champion: SM 0.097 vs the NLP's 0.080 — same window,
  consistent. Residual caveats: the Munk term is a slender-body estimate for a
  fat pod, and LL's Cm noise is averaged, not eliminated — flow5 should still
  own the final stability verdict. Remaining NLP-vs-re-eval gap ~4% is
  V-grid quantization plus this SM estimator difference.
- Tripped Δ(objective) ≈ −9 to −11 min across candidates: the design survives
  losing its laminar runs, but calibrating print-surface reality matters.
- Chain efficiency ~0.39–0.45 at cruise: the 900 kV motor is far from its happy
  point at 25 W. If hardware were ever revisited, a lower-Kv motor or bigger
  pack-voltage-to-load match is the single biggest endurance lever the fixed
  equipment list is hiding.

## 5. Next calibration actions (highest value first)

1. Slice 2–3 wing sections at different chords → `tools/fit_profile.py` →
   calibrated construction profile (turns mass model from ballpark to data).
2. ~~Stall limit / span cap decisions~~ — decided 2026-07-23: stall stays
   8.0 m/s; span cap raised to 3.0 m, revealing the 2.59 m interior optimum.
   Open follow-up: whether a 2.6 m wing is acceptable for transport/handling,
   and whether the 14 mm spar-OD ceiling (root-section fit) is right.
3. XFOIL spot-check of AG35 vs SD7037 at Re 150–200k (one-off, per §3.1) before
   committing the airfoil switch.
